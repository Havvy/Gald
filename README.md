** TODO: Everything **

This project has known vulnerabilities. Don't use it in a production environment.

Of course, this code is not actually licensed to you, so using it in production
is already a bad idea. (Yeah, projects on GitHub aren't immediately free to use,
they also need a permissive license which this project doesn't have yet. That said,
feel free to look around and learn.

Please don't send PRs right now. Everything is in flux and your PR is likely to fix
something that is just a temporary hack anyways.

"To hack and hack and hack, but to hack less as time goes on."
