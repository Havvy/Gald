A region is a place that allows you to explore, battle, and do some unique
actions at. Each one is a large piece of content, so they help define the
theme of the game quite a lot.

## Mechanics

### Exploration

Every region's landing page has an "Explore" option that unfolds a random
event associated with that region. To keep the variety up and keep people from
gaming exploration, every region must have a minimum of six random events
that can happen. To avoid making regions too complex, as we want the ability
to make specific regions unavailable, there should be no more than twelve
random events. These random events should never cause a battle.

Of those random events, one of them should be a rare event (drawn only 5% of
the time) that gives a huge lore boost to whomever receives the event. Finding
this rare event should unlock a unique option for the region.

For example, The Blood Swamp's rare event would be the finding of an eldrich
horror's remains - or at least a small part of its remains. The player, upon
finding it, would then learn that The Blood Swamp exists because Gald was
once attacked by this eldritch horror.

The unique option for The Blood Swamp would be Purification Ritual. With
knowledge in hand that this swamp is an artifact of eldritch corruption, the
player can bring together anti-corrupting artifacts and purify the swamp
forever. Doing this makes The Blood Swamp inaccessible for the rest of the game.
It also nets the player an achievement and gives them the "Remove Region: The
Blood Swamp" card to put in their decks.

### Battle

Every region has a chance for you to battle its denizens. There must be one
and only one encounter for every battle level in the game. These monsters must
be unique, though it's allowed that they just be reskins of other monsters.

### Travel Item

There exists an item that let's you travel to that region whenever you want.

Usually this is a focus to let the mind only think of that place. For The Blood
Swamp, this item would be a blood-soaked twig.

Gathering this item should always be an option available on the landing page,
unless the player already has the item.

### Unique Options

A region should have one to three unique options. For The Blood Swamp, the
blood acts as a catalyst for demonic arts, so the player can practice that.
Should they be more hungry than testing their demonic prowess, they can choose
to fish for some delectable bloodfish.

## Landing Page

The landing page must have a banner image showing what the region looks like.

It also shows the seven options, but instead of just showing them as buttons,
go for a Fallen London style of options where there's a description giving
lore about the region.
