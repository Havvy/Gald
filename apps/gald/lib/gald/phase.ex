  This server handles a single phase as part of a player's turn.

  A phase is made of an initial screen and the sequence of screens that follow
  depending upon the player's choices or until something aborts the sequence.

  An example of something that ends a sequence early is an externally caused
  death, though death caused by a sequence should be handled in the sequence.
