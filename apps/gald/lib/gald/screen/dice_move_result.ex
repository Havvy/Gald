  The structue for a screen showing the result of rolling dice
  for movement.

  * player_name: `player_name`
  * roll: `{{:d, 6}, [positive_integer]}`
  * to: `{relative, absolute} - e.g., rolling a total of 10 from space 15 gives `{10, 25}`.

  The `roll` is used to decide which dice images to show to the player.

  The `to` is used for the textual description of how the move happened.
