  Invoked when the screen sequence is started.

  `init_arg` is a map with data dependent upon the individual screen sequence.
  For the beginning of a sequence, the map will contain only `race` and `player`.

  The return value is data that is sent to the other callbacks. Kind of like
  `state` in a GenServer.

  If you need the player's name for display, save it in your data.
