defmodule Gald.Screen do
  @moduledoc """
  A screen being a page shown to everybody detailing the actions of
  what's happened while also showing and handling which options the
  current player can take.

  All individual screens must implement this behaviour and must
  be in the Gald.Screen namespace. When passing a screen_name, do not prefix
  the module with Gald.Screen - the server will do that for you.

  ## Action and Result Pattern

  Some screens have forced actions where there's a choice or randomness
  that needs to be decided. These screens will point to a result screen
  for their next screen when the player makes a choice.

  Those result screens' modules should be in the same file as the action
  screen, but with the module name having "Result" appended to it. So, for
  example, `Gald.Screen.Test.SetHealth` has a `Gald.Screen.Test.SetHealthResult`
  counterpart.

  The logical affect of choosing the option should be in the action screen's
  `handle_player_option/2`.

  Invoked right before displaying the screen.

  `init_arg` is a map with data dependent upon the individual screen sequence.
  It will always contain a `race`, `player`, and `player_name`. For the
  beginning of a sequence, it will contain no other keys. After that, it will
  contain whatever additional keys the previous screen passed when sending a
  `{:next, screen_name, data}`.

  The return value is state that is sent to the other callbacks. This is
  analogous to the `state` in a GenServer.

  When you screen has side effects as a result of initialization, this is
  where those side effects are located.
