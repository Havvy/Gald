  Invoked right before displaying the screen.

  `init_arg` is a map with data dependent upon the individual screen sequence.
  It will always contain a `race`, `player`, and `player_name`. For the
  beginning of a sequence, it will contain no other keys. After that, it will
  contain whatever additional keys the previous screen passed when sending a
  `{:next, screen_name, data}`.

  The return value is state that is sent to the other callbacks. This is
  analogous to the `state` in a GenServer.

  When you screen has side effects as a result of initialization, this is
  where those side effects are located.
